# Professional README Generator

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

I was motivated to build the Professional README Generator to simplify the process of creating professional high-quality README files for developers. The Professional README Generator automates the creation of professional, well-structured README files, saving developers time and ensuring consistency. I learned how to effectively use Node.js, the Inquirer package, and modular JavaScript design to create dynamic markdown files.

## Usage

To use the Professional README Generator, simply run npm start or node index.js in your terminal. You will be prompted to answer several questions about your project. Once you've answered all the questions, a professional README.md file will be generated and saved in the dist folder.
