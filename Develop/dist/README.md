# Sample Project

## Description
I was motivated to create this Sample Project to demonstrate the functionality of the Professional README Generator. This tool simplifies the process of generating high-quality README files for developers by automating the creation process and ensuring consistency in documentation. The Sample Project addresses the challenge of manually writing README files by automating the generation process. It ensures that developers can focus more on coding rather than documentation, while still maintaining professional and detailed README files. Through this project, I learned how to leverage Node.js and the Inquirer package to create a command-line application that dynamically generates markdown files. I also gained experience in modular JavaScript design, allowing for easy maintenance and extension of the codebase.
